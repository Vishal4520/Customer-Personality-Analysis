## ✅ Task 2: Data Visualization and Storytelling

### 🎯 Objective:

To create insightful visualizations from customer data that effectively tell a business story. 
The goal is to highlight key trends, behaviors, and campaign responses to support marketing and customer segmentation strategies.

---

### 🛠 Tools Used:

* Power BI (main tool for dashboard design)
* Excel (for data cleanup and calculated columns)
* DAX (for custom KPIs and measures)

---

### 📁 Dataset:

We used a cleaned version of the **Customer Personality Analysis** dataset, which includes:

* Demographics (Age, Education, Marital Status)
* Household info (Number of children and teenagers)
* Spending behavior across product categories
* Campaign responses and shopping channel usage

---

### 🪜 Steps Completed:

1. Cleaned and prepared the dataset in Excel.
2. Created new calculated columns:

   * `age`
   * `total_spend`
   * `family_size`
   * `total_campaign_accepted`
   * `AgeGroup` (custom bins)
3. Imported cleaned dataset into Power BI.
4. Created KPI cards: Total Customers, Average Age, Average Spend, and Average Campaign Response.
5. Built various visuals to compare spending behavior, campaign engagement, and shopping channel preferences.
6. Used slicers to filter by Education, Marital Status, and AgeGroup.
7. Added contextual insights with storytelling boxes.
8. Arranged visuals into a clean, structured dashboard layout.

### 📖 Storytelling & Insights:

* Customers aged **30–39** and **60+** are the highest spenders.
* **Family Size = 0** customers (likely singles or couples with no children) spend more than others.
* **Higher education** levels are associated with higher spending and better campaign engagement.
* **Web purchases** dominate for younger customers, while **older customers** prefer stores or catalogs.
* The **average campaign acceptance** per customer is **only 0.30**, indicating a need for better personalization and targeting.

### ✅ Outcome:
